# Wacky Madlib Generator

A playful web app that lets you create wacky, AI-powered stories and images! Choose from a list of silly creatures, verbs, and adjectives, then generate a unique story and an AI-generated picture to match.

Coming Soon!

## Project Overview

**Wacky Madlib Generator** is a simple, interactive frontend built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and vanilla JavaScript. It connects to a backend powered by OpenAI (via Cloudflare Workers) to generate both stories and images based on user selections.

**This frontend app communicates with the backend through a [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/).** The AI Gateway acts as a proxy between the frontend and the OpenAI-powered backend, providing enhanced security, observability, and cost management for AI API usage.

## Features

- Select from a list of wacky creatures, verbs, and adjectives.
- Instantly generate a unique, AI-created story.
- Create a matching AI-generated image for your story.
- Fun, colorful, and easy-to-use interface.

## Architecture

```

        |  (POST /madlib, /image via Cloudflare AI Gateway)

Backend (Cloudflare Worker, OpenAI API)
```

- **Frontend**: Handles user input, displays results, and communicates with the backend via fetch requests.
- **Cloudflare AI Gateway**: Proxies requests from the frontend to the backend, providing rate limiting, logging, and security for AI API calls.
- **Backend**: Receives requests, uses OpenAI's API to generate stories and images, and returns the results.

### About Cloudflare AI Gateway

The Cloudflare AI Gateway is used to securely route all AI-related API requests from the frontend to the backend. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Security**: Hides backend endpoints and API keys from the client.
- **Observability**: Provides analytics and monitoring for AI API usage.
- **Cost Control**: Enables caching and rate limiting to manage AI costs.
- **Reliability**: Adds an extra layer of protection against abuse and downtime.

## File Structure

- `index.html` â€“ Main HTML page
- `style.css` â€“ App styling
- `script.js` â€“ Handles UI logic and API calls
- `vite.config.js` â€“ Vite configuration
- `package.json` â€“ Project metadata and scripts
- `logo.png`, `favicon.ico` â€“ Branding assets

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd wacky-madlib-chat-app-simple-example-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

- **Development mode:**
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

- **Production build:**
  ```sh
  npm run build
  npm run preview
  ```

## Usage

1. Select a creature, verb, and adjective from the dropdowns.
2. Click **Generate Story** to create your wacky story.
3. Click **Create a Picture** to generate an AI image based on your story.

## Backend Endpoints

- `/madlib` â€“ Accepts `{ noun, verb, adjective }` and returns a generated story.
- `/image` â€“ Accepts `{ prompt }` (the story) and returns a base64-encoded image.

> **Note:** The backend is hosted at  
> `https://openai-worker.kathleen-elizabeth-west.workers.dev/`  
> All requests are routed through the Cloudflare AI Gateway for security and observability.

## Caching

To reduce AI costs, story and image responses are cached for 1 month.

## Backend Project

[cloudflare-openai-worker](https://github.com/kathleenwest/cloudflare-openai-worker)

A Cloudflare Worker with simple HTTP endpoints for generating Madlib stories and images using OpenAI APIs. Features /madlib for story creation and /image for AI-generated images. Built with itty-router and the OpenAI Node.js SDK.
